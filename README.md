This is a demo implementation of a product 'star-app' of a fictitous entity known as AchiStar Technologies as per the below requirements.

Problem Description:
DESCRIPTION

Demonstrate the continuous integration and delivery by Dockerizing Jenkins Pipeline.

Problem Statement Scenario: 
You are a DevOps consultant in AchiStar Technologies. The company decided to implement DevOps to develop and deliver their products. Since it is an Agile organization,

    • Git – To connect and push files from local system to GitHub
    • Linux (Ubuntu) – As a base operating system to start and execute the project
    • Jenkins – To automate the deployment process during continuous integration


Following requirements should be met:
    • Document the step-by-step process from the initial installation to the final stage.
    • Track the versions of the code in the GitHub repository
    • Availability of the application in the Docker Hub
    • Track the build status of Jenkins for every increment of the project
